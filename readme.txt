The plugin removes the slow-loading post preview iframe from the post/page writing screen and adds a preview link instead.

== Description ==

Support and development is stopped!
The functionality given by this plugin is built into WP versions from 2.2 anyway...

The plugin removes the preview iframe and adds a preview link instead: The preview iframe in the post/page writing screen will be removed to load this page faster. Additionally there will be a link to the preview in the upper right corner of the screen, which opens a new window to the preview of the edited post/page.
The plugin is based on the [Kill Preview plugin](http://redalt.com/Resources/Plugins/Kill+Preview) by Owen Winkler, that did not work with WordPress 2.1. This version does ;)

== Installation ==

Just drop the file "killpreview.php" from the zip-file into your plugin directory and activate the plugin.

== Configuration ==

No configuration needed!
